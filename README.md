# antidiscordgate
Stops the raider group "DiscordGate" / "dcgate"
discordgate is a raider group that popped out of nowhere 3 days ago, and nothing was being done about it, so I decided to make this bot to auto ban raiders from the DiscordGate raider group. What this group does is flood tons of fake members into your Discord server. This bot will ban those members, right when they join. When you invite this bot, it will also automatically ban any preexisting DiscordGate raiders.

# Report these bots to Discord
Please report this raider group to discord by [clicking here](https://dis.gd/report) so the group gets banned and we don't have to use workarounds like these.
